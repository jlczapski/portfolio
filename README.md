## Janusz Czapski's Site

This website serves as an online CV, going into detail about my past development experience & education, as opposed to a portfolio site of previous projects. 

The tech stack is fairly simple, as the site is mostly static, and was built using a combination of: 

+ HTML
+ Tailwind CSS
+ JavaScript

Webpack & Babel were used for creating a dev environment & building assets, alongside PostCSS for removing unused styles & minifying output. 

Please take a look around!
